# node-constructor-wordguess

This project used constructors to randomly select a Car word from the array and then hide it with _ underscores and take input from the user with inquirer.  It takes that input and determines if the input matches the object in the array letter.  If it does it replaces the underscore and replaces it with the correct letter.  You get 10 guesses before you get exited from the program.  I have some exit catch statements in there to check for errors but I could not finish index I was having some problems with the logic on how to call some of the functions.
